<h1>Ahoy Christmas!</h1>

<p>Welcome to my annual (and often times doomed) attempt at conquering Advent of Code!</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of it, it's a delightful challenge created by Eric Wastl where you tackle small coding tasks every day of the advent calendar to sharpen your coding skills. </p>
<p>This year, I wanted to experiment with some frontend work, so I chose Blazor—consider this a trial run. </p>
<p>To get started, just click on the calendar at the top left and find the door you want to solve in the ever-shuffling advent calendar.</p>
<p>Enjoy the challenge! (This is obviously me talking to myself, as you, the viewer, are just using this to check out my work)</p>
